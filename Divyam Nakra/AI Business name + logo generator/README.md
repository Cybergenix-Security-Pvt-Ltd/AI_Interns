## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Tell Us Your Idea**  
   Enter a one-line business description, 3–5 keywords, industry, and style preference (e.g., playful, premium, tech).

2. **Name Ideas**  
   AI suggests 20–30 names in different styles: invented, descriptive, or short & catchy.

3. **Smart Filter**  
   Automatically removes restricted words and shows syllable count and name length.

4. **Domain Availability**  
   Checks if `.com` or `.in` domains are available.

5. **Logo Generation**  
   Creates 6 logo concepts for the top 5 names (wordmark, lettermark, icon, abstract, combination, badge) with option to convert to SVG.

6. **Gallery View**  
   Displays all names with logo thumbnails, matching color palettes, font pair suggestions, and short taglines.

7. **Export Kit**  
   Selected name + logo + color HEX codes + font links + one-page brand sheet PDF → packaged as a downloadable ZIP file.
